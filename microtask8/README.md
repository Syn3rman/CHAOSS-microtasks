## Set up Kidash and Archimedes to be executed from PyCharm. Export any dashboard available in your local Kibiter using Kidash and Archimedes.

#### Kidash

Assuming that you have followed the steps in microtask 4, you should have grimoire-kidash in you development env.

Navigate to that directory and run the command

```
python3 setup.py install
```
to install kidash.

You can use the following command to export a dashboard using kidash:

```
kidash -g -e https://admin:admin@localhost:9200 --dashboard Overview --export overview.json

```

The ouput file generated by the above command can be found [here](./overview.json).

We can see that Kidash packages and stores all the Kibana artifacts like visualizations, searches and index patterns into a single JSON file, making it easy to share with others.

More details about the keys of the artifacts and their meaning can be read over [here](https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-under-the-hood-object-persistence).


#### Archimedes

Clone the repo to your machine using 

```
git clone https://github.com/Bitergia/archimedes
```

and then run 
```
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install
```
to install archimedes.

Now, you can use the following command to inspect the saved objects on your Kibana instance:

```
 archimedes http://admin:admin@localhost:5601 --inspect --remote
```

Now you can export any artifact using archimedes, by using it's title, id or alias.

Example:
Command:
```
 archimedes http://admin:admin@localhost:5601 . --export --obj-type dashboard --obj-title "GitLab Merge Requests Timing" --force
```

Output:

Inspecting the directory structure, we find:

Thus, we can see that in contrast to Kidash, archimedes exports visualizations, index patterns and searches to different folders.
