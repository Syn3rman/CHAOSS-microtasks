## Download PyCharm and get familiar with it.

On ubuntu 18.04, you can use snap to download pycharm using the command:

```
sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic
```

And then (optionally) setting the alias by opening the /etc/bash.bashrc file with: 

```
vim /etc/bash.bashrc
```

and appending the following line to the end of the file:
```
alias pycharm='/snap/bin/pycharm-community'
```

Now you can follow the tutorial [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html) to get familiar with it.
