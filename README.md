## Repo for microtasks for the idea "Packaging and Sharing CHAOSS metrics using GrimoireLab dashboards"

## Introduction

GrimoireLab is a powerful toolset for software development analytics. It is able to collect, process and visualize data from a large plethora of tools and platforms used in software development. The obtained data is stored in ElasticSearch and shown via web-based dashboards built on top of Kibana. Predefined dashboards are provided by GrimoireLab, however each user can easily create their own ones to address specific needs, such as the implementation of CHAOSS metrics.

## Idea

In the current stage, GrimoireLab doesn't provide an approach to share custom dashboards, thus limiting the end-user capabilities. This project idea is about implementing such an approach leveraging on Python, the Kibana API, ElasticSearch and OpenDistro for ElasticSearch (ODFE).
